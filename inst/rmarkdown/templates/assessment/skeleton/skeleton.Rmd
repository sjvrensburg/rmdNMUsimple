# Theory [25 Marks]

\question[5] Describe heteroskedasticity and its implications for OLS estimation.

\begin{solution}
Heteroskedasticity occurs when the variance of the error terms is not constant across observations.
\end{solution}

\question[10] Consider the AR(1) process: $Y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Y_{t-1} + \nu_t$

\begin{parts}
\part[5] State the stationarity condition.
\begin{solution}
The process is stationary if $|\alpha_1| < 1$.
\end{solution}

\part[5] Derive the unconditional mean when the process is stationary.
\begin{solution}
Taking expectations and solving for $\mu = \frac{\alpha_0}{1-\alpha_1}$.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
