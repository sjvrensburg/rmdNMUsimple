# Theory Section [25 Marks]

\question[10] This is a question.

\begin{solution}
Solution environments contain the answers to questions. Switching solutions to true in the YAML will cause solutions to render in the knitted PDF document.
\end{solution}

\question We can have sub-questions, each with their own solution.

\begin{parts}
\part[1] Part 1's question.
\begin{solution}
Part 1's model answer.
\end{solution}


\part[1] Part 2's question.
\begin{solution}
Part 2's model answer.
\end{solution}

\part[1] Part 3's question.
\begin{solution}
Part 3's model answer.
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\question[5] Define heteroskedasticity and explain its implications for ordinary least squares estimation.

\begin{solution}
Heteroskedasticity occurs when error term variance varies across observations, violating the homoskedasticity assumption. This leads to inefficient coefficient estimates and incorrect standard errors, though estimates remain unbiased.
\end{solution}

\question Consider the autoregressive process: $Y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Y_{t-1} + \nu_t$

\begin{parts}
\part[5] State the stationarity condition.

\begin{solution}
The process exhibits stationarity when $|\alpha_1| < 1$.
\end{solution}

\part[5] Derive the unconditional mean under stationarity.

\begin{solution}
Under stationarity: $\mu = \frac{\alpha_0}{1-\alpha_1}$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

# Practical Component [25 Marks]

\question[25] Complete the computational exercises on Moodle.

\begin{solution}
Students should demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, model specification, and results interpretation.
\end{solution}
