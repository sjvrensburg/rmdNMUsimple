# Section 1

## Bullet Points

- We can use itemised lists as with any standard set of R Markdown Beamer slides
- Here is another point...

  - You can also have nested items
  - More!

## Numbered Lists

1. We can use enumerated lists as with any standard set of R Markdown Beamer slides
2. Here is another point...

  1. You can also have nested items
  2. More!
  
## {.plain}

1. You can even mix the two
  
  - Something
  - Something
  
2. Something else

# Section 2

## Mathematical Expressions

The Laspeyres price index formula:

$$I_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i,\text{base}} P_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i,\text{base}} P_{i,\text{base}}} \times 100$$

```{r eval=FALSE}
# R code example
laspeyres_index <- function(quantities_base, prices_base, prices_t) {
  numerator <- sum(quantities_base * prices_t)
  denominator <- sum(quantities_base * prices_base)
  return((numerator / denominator) * 100)
}
```

## Customisation

Remember, you can add your own header includes by editing the YAML header of the R Markdown document.
