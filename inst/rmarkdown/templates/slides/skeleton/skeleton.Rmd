## What is an Index Number?

- An index number, or simply an index, indicates the level of a variable relative to its level at another period of time or place.

- The variable of interest can be
  - a single item, in which case the index is known as a single index or
  - a group of items, in which case the index is known as a composite index.

- A variable can be tangible (the price of a basket of goods) or intangible (business confidence).

## Definition of An Index Number

For an index that measures the level of a variable in period $t$ relative to some base period,

$$I_t = \frac{\text{Level for period } t}{\text{Level for base period}} \times 100$$

The base period is the point in time, in the past, against which all comparisons are made.

## Example: Mathematical Expression

The Laspeyres price index formula:

$$I_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i,\text{base}} P_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} Q_{i,\text{base}} P_{i,\text{base}}} \times 100$$

```{r eval=FALSE}
# R code example
laspeyres_index <- function(quantities_base, prices_base, prices_t) {
  numerator <- sum(quantities_base * prices_t)
  denominator <- sum(quantities_base * prices_base)
  return((numerator / denominator) * 100)
}
```
